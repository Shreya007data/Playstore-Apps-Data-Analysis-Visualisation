# Playstore Apps Data Analysis & Visualisation
## About :
This project is a real live Data Analysis challenge conducted by HiCounsellor on LinkedIn, with this live project opportunity, I have gained experience working with real-world databases. I participated along with my team of 3 Data Analysts (Team - Data Ninjas). We have worked as a team, beyond the different time zones problem, we have shown our teamwork, cross-functional, and communication skills perfectly here.

In this project, I worked on a real-world dataset of the Google Play Store, one of the most used applications for downloading Android apps. This project aims on cleaning the dataset, analyze the given dataset, and mining informational quality insights. This project also involves visualizing the data to better and easily understand trends in Google Play Store apps.

## Project Description :

This project helped me to understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using Python for better upcoming performance, how SQL helps us retrieve useful information from the database, and visualize the data with the Power Bi tool. The Project will consist of 2 modules as directed by HiCounsellor the organizers of this challenge:

Module 1: Pre-processing, Analyzing data using Python, Excel and MySQL.

Module 2: Visualizing data using Power Bi.


## Module 1 :

### Task 1 : Pre-processing data using Python (NumPy, Pandas) -
1) Imported NumPy, Pandas library using Python.
2) Checked for Duplicate rows in both Playstore_apps and Playstore_reviews datasets and deleted them using the drop_duplicates.
3) Using unique function of NumPy library to get a list of all the unique values present in every column of both datasets, if a unique value does not comply with the data type of the column then removed all the rows having that unique value.
4) Exported the cleaned dataset of both Playstore_apps and Playstore_reviews as a .csv file.

###  Task 2 : Preparing the data using MS Excel -
1) Opened the exported file in excel and checked for the null values in each column using the find and replace tool in Excel.
2) Encoded our data using UTF-8, and saved it as a csv file.

###  Task 3 : Analyzing and querying the dataset using MySQL -

## Module 2 :
In this module, I have visualized both datasets using Power Bi to know what the numbers in and behind the data want to convey. I have created a dashboard for the same using different statistical graphs and diagrams for a visual understanding and analysis.
